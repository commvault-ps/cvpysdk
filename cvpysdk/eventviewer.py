    This class provides an interface to interact with event data within a commcell environment.
    It allows querying for events based on specific parameters, retrieving detailed information

    Key Features:
        - Initialize with a commcell object to establish context
        - Query and retrieve lists of events using customizable parameters
        - Fetch detailed information for a specific event by event ID
        - Provides string and representation methods for user-friendly output
