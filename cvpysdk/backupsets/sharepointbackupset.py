    Represents a SharePoint backupset, extending the Backupset base class.

    This class is designed to manage and perform operations specific to SharePoint backupsets,
    including support for both SharePoint Online and integration with Azure storage accounts.
    It provides properties to determine the type of SharePoint instance and to access Azure storage details,
    as well as methods to handle Azure storage account information.

    Key Features:
        - Identification of SharePoint Online instances
        - Access to Azure storage account details
        - Management of Azure storage account information for backup operations
