    Represents a VMWare instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class encapsulates the details and management of a VMWare instance,
    providing an interface for initializing and handling VMWare-specific
    virtual server instances within the broader backup or virtualization
    management framework.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent object, instance name, and instance ID
        - Specialized for VMWare virtual server environments
        - Inherits core functionality from the base Instance class
