"""File for operating on a Virtual Server Amazon Instance.

GoogleCloudInstance is the only class defined in this file.

GoogleCloudInstance: Derived class from VirtualServer  Base class, representing a
                    Google Cloud Platform instance, and to perform operations on that instance

GoogleCloudInstance:
    __init__(agent_object,instance_name,instance_id)    --  initialize object of Google Cloud
                                                            Platform Instance object associated
                                                            with the VirtualServer Instance

    Represents a Google Cloud virtual server instance within a virtual server management framework.

    This class provides mechanisms to initialize and manage Google Cloud instances, retrieve their
    properties, and access key server information such as server name and host name. It is designed
    to integrate with an agent and supports property-based access to important instance attributes.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization of Google Cloud instance objects with agent, name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties in both standard and JSON formats
        - Property accessors for server name and server host name
        - Inherits from VirtualServerInstance for extended virtual server management capabilities
