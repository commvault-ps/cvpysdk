    Represents a Hyper-V instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors specific to a Hyper-V
    virtual server instance, providing mechanisms to initialize the instance,
    retrieve its properties, and access key server information.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent, instance name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties and their JSON representation
        - Access to server name and server host name via properties
