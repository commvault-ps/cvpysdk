"""File for operating on a Virtual Server Xen Server Instance.

XenServer Instance is the only class defined in this file.

XenInstance: Derived class from VirtualServer  Base class, representing a
                           Xen Server instance, and to perform operations on that instance

    Represents a Xen Server instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors specific to a Xen Server
    instance, providing mechanisms to retrieve and manage instance properties,
    as well as access and modify server host and server names. It is designed to
    integrate with the broader Virtual Server agent framework.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent, instance name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties and their JSON representation
        - Access and modification of the server host name via property
        - Access to the server name via property
