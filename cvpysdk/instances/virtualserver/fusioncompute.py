    Represents a Fusion Compute instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors specific to a Fusion Compute
    instance, providing mechanisms to initialize the instance, retrieve its properties,
    and access key server-related information. It is designed to interact with the
    underlying agent and manage instance-specific data.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent, instance name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties in both standard and JSON formats
        - Access to server host name and server name via properties
        - Access to the associated username via a protected property
