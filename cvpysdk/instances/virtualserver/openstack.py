    Represents an OpenStack instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class provides an interface for handling OpenStack virtual server instances,
    allowing retrieval and management of instance properties and metadata. It includes
    methods for initializing the instance with specific parameters, accessing instance
    properties in both object and JSON formats, and retrieving key attributes such as
    server host name, username, and server name.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent object, instance name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties as objects and JSON
        - Access to server host name, username, and server name via properties
