    Represents a VCloud instance within the Virtual Server agent framework.

    This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors specific to a VCloud
    instance, providing mechanisms to initialize the instance, retrieve its
    properties, and access key attributes such as server host name, username,
    and server name. It is designed to interact with the underlying Virtual
    Server agent infrastructure, enabling management and inspection of VCloud
    instance configurations.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization of VCloud instance with agent object, name, and ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties and their JSON representation
        - Access to server host name, username, and server name via properties
