    Represents a Nutanix AHV instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors specific to a Nutanix AHV
    virtual server instance, providing mechanisms to retrieve and manage instance
    properties, as well as access key configuration details such as server host name,
    Nutanix cluster, and associated username.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent, instance name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties and their JSON representation
        - Access to server host name, Nutanix cluster, and username via properties
