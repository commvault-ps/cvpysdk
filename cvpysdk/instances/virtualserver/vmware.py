    Represents a VMware instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors specific to a VMware
    virtual server instance, providing mechanisms to retrieve and manage
    instance properties and metadata. It is designed to interface with the
    broader Virtual Server agent framework, allowing for seamless integration
    and management of VMware environments.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent object, instance name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties and their JSON representation
        - Access to server host name, username, and server name via properties
