    Represents an Alibaba Cloud instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors specific to an Alibaba Cloud
    virtual server instance. It provides mechanisms to initialize the instance with
    relevant identifiers, retrieve instance properties in both object and JSON formats,
    and access key attributes such as server host name, server name, and instance username.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent, instance name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties as objects and JSON
        - Access to server host name, server name, and instance username via properties
