    Represents an Azure virtual server instance within the virtualization management framework.

    This class provides mechanisms to interact with and manage Azure-based virtual server instances.
    It allows for initialization with agent and instance details, retrieval of instance properties,
    and access to server-specific information such as server name and host name.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent, name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties in both standard and JSON formats
        - Access to server name and server host name via properties
