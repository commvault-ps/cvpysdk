    Represents an Oracle VM instance managed by the Virtual Server agent.

    This class provides an interface for handling Oracle VM instances within the
    Virtual Server environment. It allows for initialization with agent details,
    retrieval of instance properties, and access to key server information.

    Key Features:
        - Initialize Oracle VM instance with agent object, name, and ID
        - Retrieve instance properties and their JSON representation
        - Access server host name and server name via properties
