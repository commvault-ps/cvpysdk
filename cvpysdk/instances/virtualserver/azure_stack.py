    Represents an Azure Stack instance for the Virtual Server agent.

    This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors specific to an Azure Stack
    instance within the context of virtual server management. It provides mechanisms
    to initialize the instance, retrieve its properties, and access key Azure Stack
    identifiers such as server host name, subscription ID, and application ID.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with agent, name, and instance ID
        - Retrieval of instance properties and their JSON representation
        - Access to Azure Stack-specific properties:
            - server_host_name
            - subscriptionid
            - applicationid
