    Represents a specialized database instance derived from the Instance base class.

    This class is designed to manage and perform operations on database instances,
    providing methods for initialization, restore operations, and retrieval of source
    items for application-free backups. It facilitates interaction with backup jobs,
    disk restore processes, and source item management within the context of database
    instance operations.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization of database instance with agent, name, and ID
        - Generation of restore-to-disk JSON payloads for backup jobs
        - Retrieval of source items for application-free backup jobs
