File for operating with Big Data Apps Instance.

BigDataAppsInstance:    Derived class from Instance Base class, representing a
bigdata apps instance, and to perform operations on that instance

    Represents an instance of the BigDataApps agent.

    This class is designed to encapsulate the creation and management of a BigDataApps agent instance,
    providing a structured way to associate an agent object with a unique instance name and identifier.

    Key Features:
        - Instantiates a BigDataApps agent instance using agent object, name, and ID
        - Ensures proper initialization and association of instance metadata
        - Inherits from the base Instance class for extended functionality

        This method is responsible for instantiating the appropriate subclass of BigDataAppsInstance
        depending on the cluster type associated with the provided agent object, instance name, and instance ID.

        Args:
            agent_object: The agent object associated with the BigDataApps instance.
            instance_name: The name of the instance to be created.
            instance_id: The unique identifier for the instance.

        Returns:
            An object representing the BigDataApps instance, which may be a specific subclass
            depending on the cluster type.

        Example:
            >>> instance = BigDataAppsInstance(agent_object, "HadoopCluster01", 101)
            >>> print(f"Created instance: {instance}")
            >>> # The returned object will be of the appropriate subclass for the cluster type
