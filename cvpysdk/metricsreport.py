    """
    Base class for common operations in Metrics reporting.

    This class provides a comprehensive set of methods and properties for managing,
    configuring, and monitoring metrics reporting services. It is designed to be
    inherited by both Private and Cloud metrics classes, offering a unified interface
    for metrics configuration, service state management, data collection, upload
    scheduling, and health/activity/audit controls.

    Key Features:
        - Metrics configuration retrieval and refresh
        - Service state management (enable/disable health, activity, audit, post-upgrade check, chargeback, etc.)
        - Upload frequency and data collection window configuration
        - Client group management for metrics reporting
        - Enable/disable all metrics services
        - Manual and scheduled metrics upload operations
        - Wait mechanisms for download, collection, and upload completion with timeout support
        - Access to key metrics properties (last download/collection/upload times, next upload time, upload frequency)
        - Retrieval of uploaded file and zip filenames for reporting
        - Saving and updating metrics configuration

    This class is intended for internal use as a base for more specialized metrics
    reporting classes, providing essential building blocks for metrics management
    in both private and cloud environments.
