    Controller class for managing jobs associated with a CommCell.

    The JobController class provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with

    job summaries, query job lists based on status and filters, and perform bulk
    operations on jobs such as suspending, resuming, or killing all jobs. The class
    also supports fetching details of individual jobs by job ID.

    Key Features:
        - Retrieve active job summaries
        - List all jobs, active jobs, or finished jobs with filtering options
        - Perform bulk operations: suspend, resume, or kill all jobs
        - Modify jobs based on operation type
        - Fetch details of a specific job by job ID
        - Internal utilities for job request and job list management

    Comprehensive class for managing and configuring job operations within a CommCell environment.

    prioritization, error handling, and operational settings. It enables administrators to fine-tune job
    management parameters, set and retrieve general, priority, restart, and update settings, and manage
    job behaviors through a variety of property-based configurations.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization with a CommCell object for context-aware job management
        - Refreshing job management settings to ensure up-to-date configurations
        - Setting and retrieving general, priority, restart, and update settings for jobs
        - Fine-grained control over job priority precedence and operational intervals
        - Configurable error rules and job error thresholds
        - Management of job queuing, throttling, and multiplexing for various agents and job types
        - Control over job behaviors such as preemption, activity windows, and backup/restore operations
        - Property-based access to all major job management settings for easy integration and automation

    This class is intended for use in environments where job execution and management require detailed
    configuration and monitoring to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

    Represents a job for performing client operations within a CommCell environment.

    This class provides comprehensive management and monitoring capabilities for jobs

    control job execution (pause, resume, kill, resubmit), retrieve job summaries and details,
    and interact with job-related logs and events.

    Key Features:
        - Initialization and validation of job instances
        - Access to extensive job properties (status, type, timing, client/agent info, etc.)
        - Job control operations: pause, resume, kill, resubmit
        - Wait for job status changes and completion with timeout support
        - Retrieval of job summaries, details, and advanced information
        - Access to job events, logs, VM lists, and child jobs
        - Ability to send job logs via email
        - Refresh and update job information
        - Task-level details and statistics (objects, files transferred, media size, etc.)

    This class is intended for use in environments where detailed job management and
