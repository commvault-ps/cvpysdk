    Class for maintaining constants related to threat scanning and analysis.

    This class serves as a centralized repository for constants used in threat
    detection, scanning, and analysis processes. It is intended to provide
    consistent and reusable values across different components of a threat
    management system.

    Key Features:
        - Centralized management of threat-related constants
        - Facilitates consistency in threat scan and analysis operations

    throughout the codebase wherever file type anomaly constants are required,
    promoting consistency and maintainability.

    Key Features:
        - Centralized management of file type anomaly constants
        - Improves code readability and maintainability
        - Facilitates easy updates to anomaly-related constants
