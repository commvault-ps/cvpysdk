"""File for doing operations on an Storage Pools.

This module has classes defined for doing operations for Storage Pools:

StoragePools, StoragePoolType, StorageType, WORMLockType and StoragePool are the classes defined in this file.

StoragePools: Class for representing all the StoragePools in the commcell

StoragePoolType : Class for representing storage pool types like deduplication, secondary copy, non-dedupe, scale out

StorageType : Class for representing storage types like disk, cloud, tape of a storage pool

WORMLockType : Class for representing different WORM lock types flag values of a WORM enable storage pool

StoragePool: Class for representing a single StoragePool of the commcell

                - vendor_id (int): Cloud vendor ID (e.g., 3 for Azure).
                - display_vendor_id (int): Storage class ID for the vendor (e.g., 401 for Azure Hot).
                - region_id (int): Cloud hypervisor-specific region ID.
