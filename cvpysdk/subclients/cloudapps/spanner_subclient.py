"""File for operating on a Google Cloud Spanner Subclient.

GoogleSpannerSubclient is the only class defined in this file.

GoogleSpannerSubclient:    Derived class from CloudAppsSubclient Base class, representing a
Google Cloud Spanner subclient, and to perform operations on that subclient

GoogleSpannerSubclient:

    _get_subclient_properties()         --  gets the properties of Google Subclient

    content()                           --  sets the content of the subclient

    discover()                          --  runs database discovery on subclient

    Represents a subclient for Google Cloud Spanner within the CloudApps framework.

    This class extends the CloudAppsSubclient base class to provide specialized
    operations and management for Google Cloud Spanner subclients. It includes
    methods for retrieving subclient properties and managing subclient content.

    Key Features:
        - Retrieve subclient properties specific to Google Cloud Spanner
        - Access and manage subclient content via a property interface
        - Inherits core functionality from CloudAppsSubclient
