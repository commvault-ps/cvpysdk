    Represents a LNDM subclient, derived from the LNSubclient base class.

    This class provides specialized operations for managing and restoring data
    associated with a LNDM subclient. It supports both in-place and out-of-place
    restore functionalities, allowing users to recover data to its original location
    or to a different client and destination path.

    Key Features:
        - In-place restore: Restore files and directories to their original locations
        - Out-of-place restore: Restore files and directories to a different client and path
        - Options for overwriting existing data and restoring data with ACLs
        - Support for specifying copy precedence and time ranges for restore operations
